Let’s begin by getting pytesseract installed. To install pytesseract we’ll take advantage of pip .
pip install pytesseract

Pytesseract is a wrapper for Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, 
as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others
Using Pytesseract, you can get the bounding box information for your OCR results.

Using pytessract we can draw a box around our each character.
